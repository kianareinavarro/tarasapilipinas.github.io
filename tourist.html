        <h6 class="font-x2 heading">Taal Volcano,<br>Tagaytay</h6>
        <p>Taal Volcano, reputed to be the smallest active volcano in the world, 
          is visible at dining establishments and other attractions that are located along 
          the ride on the Aguinaldo highway. Aside from relishing the cool weather, taking a moment to have a glimpse of Taal Lake and Volcano from Tagaytay City restaurants, cafes, and hotels has become a must-do for returning visitors.
          Its prime location along a mountain ridge gives you an unobstructed view of the famous “island within a lake, inside a volcano”. <br><br><br> Take note that Taal Volcano is active so always
          check first for advisories on its activities before planning a Tagaytay trip.</p>

            <p>A reconstructed Cordillera village is found in Barangay Pinsao, four kilometers from Baguio City center. It is an open-air museum where traditional huts are displayed, 
          complete with cultural information. It also showcased the tribal arts by well-known Cordillera artists. It is opened in 1998 by Chanum Foundation, to show a model village accessible to the public especially 
          those who are unable to go to the more mountainous parts of Cordillera. Most of the huts were transported from Ifugao and Kalinga, and some are reconstructed using traditional materials and methods.<br><br>
          Despite being small which you walk around the entire site for two hours, but the information, arts and cultural themes it contains are enough to have a peek and be immersed on the lifestyle of our compatriots 
          in Cordillera.</p>

                <p>Calle Crisologo is a street of old Spanish structures, mostly houses of wealthy families and Filipino-Chinese traders. 
              This is where you’ll see the famous cobblestone streets that represent Vigan’s image. Calle Crisologo was also called “Kasanglayan” (place of the Chinese), which was the business center of the foreign migratory 
              traders including Chinese, Spanish, Mexican, Japanese and other European businessmen. <br><br> Calle Crisologo is more than just a cobblestone street but also has a rich history you should know about. 
              From the Calle Crisologo description to Calle Crisologo love story (which is by the way heartwarming), you’ll definitely be entertained!</p>

                  <p>Barracuda Lake feels like a dream world. The entrance to the lake leads you along a path that winds through jagged rocks that look straight out of a movie before they reveal the beautiful, expansive Barracuda Lake. 
                The lake is huge but swimmers enjoy an enclosed area of free-diving paradise in the deep waters. Underwater cliffs will blow your mind as you snorkel or free dive in this fresh-water lake in Coron Island. 
                Occasionally referred to as Luluyuan Lake by locals, its crystal blue waters hidden between majestic rocky formations aren’t big on actual barracudas and other wildlife. Instead, divers can experience a thermocline and halocline unlike anywhere else.</p>

                    <p>Siargao Island’s Cloud 9 was dubbed as the Top 8 among the World’s Best Surfing Spots by CNNGo, a travel site of CNN International. Siargao Island is known to be the “Surfing Capital of the Philippines” and it indeed maintained its reputation 
                  by landing on the top 10 list by CNNGo. The best months to hit the waves occur between September and March. Cloud 9 offers a thick and hollow barreling left/right-hander ride and was discovered by the American photographer John S. Callahan in the late 1980s.</p>

                      <p>Pescador is a small island very close to Moalboal situated at the west coast of Cebu. The waters are extremely deep (600 m in Tañon Strait), clear (up to 35-40 m visibility), cool in temperature (27-29°C) and rich in biodiversity. 
                    It is a fantastic place to go for snorkeling because you can see different kinds of fishes, beautiful coral reefs and if you are lucky, you can also see dolphins in this island. Before going back to the mainland, 
                    you will be snorkeling with the countless sardines in the Cebu’s famed sardine run. And sometimes, sea turtles can also be found while doing this activity.</p>
